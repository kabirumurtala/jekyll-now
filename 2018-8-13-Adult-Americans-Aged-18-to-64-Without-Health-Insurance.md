In the United States, it is estimated that 16% of adults aged 18-64 years are without health insurance. From the map above, it is easily observable that there is a significant variation in the data at the state level. Compared to the rest of the country, states in the South, especially those that have not adopted the Medicaid expansion have higher rates of uninsured than the rest of the country. Texas and Georgia have rates that are greater than 25.1%. States in the Northeast and Midwest have relatively lower rates of uninsured than the rest of the country. Massachusetts, Vermont, Minnesota, and Iowa all have rates between 5.1% and 10.0%.
