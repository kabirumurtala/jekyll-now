Data from the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www.nhtsa.gov/), showed that 32,675 people in the United States of America died in motor vehicle crashes in 2014. There was a slight (0.7%) decline in motor vehicle occupant deaths in 2014, compared to the previous year. The data also revealed the following sobering statistics: \* There were approximately 90 deaths and 6,400 injuries from motor vehicle crashes every day. \* Motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause of death for young adults between the ages of 16 and 24. \* Approximately half of the passenger vehicle occupants that died (16,010) had no seat belts on. \* Alcohol-impaired driving was responsible for approximately 30% (9,967) of all the motor vehicle occupant deaths. \* Distracted driving was responsible for approximately 10% (3,179) of all motor vehicle occupant deaths

Data showed significant differences in the motor vehicle occupant death rate among different age groups and between males and females. Also, the motor vehicle occupant death rate varied widely among the 50 states.
