Drug poisoning is one of the [leading](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/factsheets/factsheet_drug_poisoning.htm) causes of unintentional death in the United States. Majority of drug poisoning death is due to accidental overdose from prescription drugs (which may be obtained legally or illegally), or over the counter (OTC) medications. Occasionally, drug poisoning death may be due to suicide, or from medical complications of drug abuse, such as septicemia, and deep vein thrombosis.

[40%](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/factsheets/factsheet_drug_poisoning.htm) of drug poisoning deaths in the US can be attributed to the use of opioid analgesics, which could be natural/semi-synthetic (oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine) or synthetic (fentanyl and methadone).

Between 1999 and 2014, the age-adjusted drug poisoning death rate in the US increased by approximately 140%, from 6.1 per 100,000 in 1999 to 14.7 per 100,000 in 2014.

In 2014, the age-adjusted drug poisoning death rate was 19.0 per 100,000 for Non-Hispanic Whites, 10.5 per 100,000 for Non-Hispanic Blacks, and 6.7 per 100,000 for Hispanics. This represented a percentage increase of 206% for Non-Hispanic Whites, 40% for Non-Hispanic Blacks, and 24% for Hispanics, since 1999.

The age-adjusted rate for drug poisoning deaths is higher among males than in females. In 2014, the age-adjusted drug poisoning death rate was 18.3 per 100,000 (up by 123% since 1999) for males, and 11.1 per 100,000 (up by 185% since 1999) for females.

Among females, the age-adjusted drug poisoning death rate in 2014 was 14.6 per 100,000 for Non-Hispanic Whites (up by 240% since 1999), 7.3 per 100,000 for Non-Hispanic Blacks (up by 83% since 1999), and 4.1 per 100,000 for Hispanics (up by 86% since 1999).

Among males, the age-adjusted drug poisoning death rate in 2014 was 23.2 per 100,000 for Non-Hispanic Whites (up by 190% since 1999), 14.2 per 100,000 for Non-Hispanic Blacks (up by 23% since 1999), and 9.3 per 100,000 for Hispanics (up by 8% since 1999).

As shown in the next 3 charts below, the drug poisoning death rate is highest for adults aged 45-54 years among Non-Hispanic White females, Non-Hispanic Black females, as well as Hispanic males and females.

When stratified by age group and gender, data showed that Non-Hispanic Whites had the highest percentage change in drug poisoning crude death rates with the exception of 0-14, and 55-64 year old females; and 0-14, 65-74, and 75+ year old males.

Deaths per 100,000 population varied by state. North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, and Texas have the lowest drug poisoning death rates with age-adjusted rates between 5.1 and 10.0 per 100,000 population. At the opposite end of the spectrum, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and West Virginia have the highest drug poisoning death rates with age-adjusted rates between 25.1 and 40.0 per 100,000 population.

Data Source
-----------

Data was obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) mortality data - a web-based data management system that collects and disseminates demographic, geographic, and cause-of-death information in the United States. The data collected are comparable for small geographic areas and are also used to compare mortality trends with other countries. More information on the data collection methods and procedures can be found [here](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm).
