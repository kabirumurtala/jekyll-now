According to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 27 people die due to alcohol impaired driving every day (this is about one death in every 53 seconds and approximately 10,000 deaths annually) in the United States. Data also shows that in 2014, death from alcohol impaired driving account for approximately one-third of motor vehicle occupant death rates in the United States, resulting in 9,967 deaths.

In all 50 states, drivers are considered to be alcohol impaired when their blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) reaches or exceeds the legal threshold of 0.08 grams per deciliter. Any fatal crash involving a driver with a BAC of 0.08 or higher is considered to be an alcohol-impaired-driving crash whether or not the fatality was caused by alcohol impairment.

The map below shows the impaired driving death rates with BAC &gt; 0.08 in 2012 by states.

Utah, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and California had the lowest impaired driving death rates with values between 0.1% to 2.0% per 100,000 population. Montana (8.1% - 10% ) and North Dakota (10.1% - 12.0%) had the highest impaired driving death rates per 100,000 population. There was incomplete data for Alaska.
