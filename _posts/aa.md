Data was obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Mortality data - a web-based data management system that collects and disseminates demographic, geographic, and cause-of-death information in the United States. The data collected are comparable for small geographic areas and are also used to compare mortality trends with other countries. More information on the data collection methods and procedures can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm).
