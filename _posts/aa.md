Among Fee For Service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries in the United States, cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of admissions in hospitals with the prevalence rate of major cardiovascular disease hospitalizations, among all hospitalizations ranging from 19.0% to 26.1%.

The Northeastern states of Vermont and Maine had the highest prevalence rates, with values greater than 24%. The Southwestern states of Utah and Colorado had the lowest prevalence rates, with values less than 20%.

When the data is stratified by race/ethnicity nationally, the prevalence of major cardiovascular disease hospitalizations among all hospitalizations, was highest among Blacks, followed by Whites, "Other ethnicity", and Hispanics in decreasing order. Between 2004 and 2013, Hispanics had the biggest drop (18%) in prevalence rates among all ethnic groups.
