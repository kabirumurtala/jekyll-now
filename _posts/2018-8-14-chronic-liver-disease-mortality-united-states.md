Chronic liver disease is the progressive destruction of the liver parenchyma (over a period greater than 6 months), leading to replacement of normal liver tissue by scar tissue.

Causes of chronic liver disease include the following:
------------------------------------------------------

-   Alcohol
-   Infections: Chronic hepatitis B and C
-   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
-   Autoimmune: autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis
-   Genetic: Cystic fibrosis, hereditary haemachromatosis, Wilson's disease, glycogen storage diseases
-   Drugs: Methotrexate, isoniazid, phenytoin, amiodarone, and nitrofurantoin

What are the symptoms of chronic liver disease?
-----------------------------------------------

Symptoms may vary, depending on the stage and severity of the disease. Patients with early stage chronic liver disease may be asymptomatic. Patients with advanced/end stage chronic liver disease develop symptoms and in some cases, life-threatening complications.

Some of the signs and symptoms include:

-   Easy fatiguability
-   Loss of appetite
-   Weight loss
-   Accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites)
-   Itching
-   Jaundice
-   Vomiting blood
-   Easy bruising
-   Spider-like veins in the skin
-   Clubbing of the nails
-   Gynaecomastia
-   Testicular atrophy
-   Shrunken/nodular liver
-   Anemia
-   Flapping tremor
-   Confusion, altered mental state, which may eventually lead to coma

Chronic liver disease mortality in the United States
----------------------------------------------------

In the United States, the mortality rates without liver transplantation in patients with end stage liver disease approached 85% within 5 years.

In 2014, the crude chronic liver disease mortality in the United States was 12 deaths per 100,000 population, and the age-adjusted mortality rate was 10.4 deaths per 100,000 population. As seen in the map below, Hawaii and mostly states in the Midwest and Northeast had the lowest (age adjusted) mortality rates. The highest (age adjusted) mortality rates were in South Dakota and New Mexico.

Data Source
-----------

Data was obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Mortality data - a web-based data management system that collects and disseminates demographic, geographic, and cause-of-death information in the United States. The data collected are comparable for small geographic areas and are also used to compare mortality trends with other countries. More information on the data collection methods and procedures can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm).
