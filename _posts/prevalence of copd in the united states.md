Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or COPD, refers to a group of progressive lung disease that cause obstruction of the airway, making it hard to empty air out of the lungs. It includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and in some cases a combination of both conditions.

Symptoms of COPD include difficulty with breathing, cough which may be associated with mucus (sputum) production, wheezing, and easy fatigability.

Smoking of tobacco products is the most common cause of COPD in the US. Other causes include exposure to air pollutants, genetic factors (alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency), and recurrent respiratory infections.

In the United States, it is estimated that more than 15 million Americans have COPD. Hawaii, Utah, and Colorado had the lowest prevalence rates of COPD with values between 2.1% and 4.0%. Kentucky (10.1% - 12% ) and West Virginia (12.1% - 14.0%) had the highest prevalence rates.
