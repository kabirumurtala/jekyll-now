The American Heart Association defines normal total cholesterol as less than 200 mg/dL, borderline total cholesterol from 200-239 mg/dL, and high total cholesterol at 240 mg/dL or above. People with levels of serum total cholesterol at or above 240 mg/dL have been identified as having a high risk for cardiovascular disease, especially coronary heart disease and stroke. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) reveals a trend toward improved cholesterol levels among US adults age 20 years and over, between 1999 and 2014.

Trends in mean serum total cholesterol levels among US adults
-------------------------------------------------------------

According to data, mean serum total cholesterol among US adults age 20 years and over decreased from 204.3 mg/dL in 1999-2000 to 189.2 mg/dL in 2013-2014.

When stratified by race, the data revealed a 7.1% drop among Non-Hispanic Blacks (197.1 mg/dL in 1999-2000 to 183.2 mg/dL in 2013-2014), and a 7.8% drop among Non-Hispanic Whites (205.6 mg/dL in 1999-2000 to 189.6 mg/dL in 2013-2014).

Stratification by age group showed a 3.7% drop among the 20-24 age group (176.4 mg/dL in 1999-2000 to 169.9 mg/dL in 2013-2014), and a 14.2% drop among the 65+ age group (215.5 mg/dL in 1999-2000 to 184.8 mg/dL in 2013-2014).

Stratification by gender showed a 6.2% drop among females (204.6 mg/dL in 1999-2000 to 191.9 mg/dL in 2013-2014), and an 8.6% drop among males (203.6 mg/Ll in 1999-2000 to 186.1 mg/dL in 2013-2014).

Prevalence of high total cholesterol among US adults age 20 years and over
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

During 2011-2014, 12.1% of adults had high total cholesterol.

Overall, more women (13.5%) than men (10.7% ) had high serum total cholesterol. The percentage with high total cholesterol was highest for adults aged 40-59 (16.0%) and lowest for adults aged 20-39 (7.5%). The percentage of Non-Hispanic Black (8.6%) adults with high total serum cholesterol was lower than for Hispanic (12.1%) and Non-Hispanic White (12.9) adults.

For men and women age 20-39 years, there are no significant differences in the prevalence of serum total cholesterol levels among the three different races. For men age 40-59 years, the prevalence of high serum total cholesterol was lower in non-Hispanic Blacks (10.1%) than in Hispanics (18.8%), however this difference was not seen in women. Among men 60 years and older, Hispanics (13.6%) had higher prevalence of high serum total cholesterol than non-Hispanic Whites (6.8%), and Non-Hispanic Blacks (5.6%). Among women 60 years and older, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of serum total cholesterol levels among the three different races.

Prevalence of low HDL cholesterol among US adults age 20 years and over
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is often referred to as "good" cholesterol because it helps remove unwanted/excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and the artery walls, transporting it back to the liver where it can be degraded. Generally, a high level of HDL cholesterol is desirable because it reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease. On other other hand, low levels of HDL cholesterol is associated with increased the risk of cardiovascular disease.

During 2011-2014, 18.5% of US adults had low HDL cholesterol.

Overall, more men (27.9%) than women (9.8% ) had low HDL cholesterol levels. There were more adults aged 40-59 years (19.8%) with low levels of HDL cholesterol than adults aged 60 years and above (15.3%). The prevalence of low HDL cholesterol was higher in both Hispanic (21.3%) and Non-Hispanic White (18.7%) adults than in Non-Hispanic Black (13.7%) adults.

For men aged 20-39 years, the prevalence of low HDL cholesterol was lower in non-Hispanic Blacks (19.3%) than in Hispanics (29.9%), and non-Hispanic Whites (28.4%); no significant difference was seen in women aged 20-39 years. In men aged 40-59 years, the prevalence of low HDL cholesterol was lower in non-Hispanic Blacks (22.5%) than in Hispanics (32.9%), with no significant difference seen in women aged 40-59 years. Among men 60 years and older, there was no significant differences in the prevalence of low HDL cholesterol levels among the three different races. Among women 60 years and older, Hispanics (10.0%) had higher prevalence of low HDL cholesterol than Non-Hispanic Blacks (3.8%).

Data Source
-----------

Data on cholesterol levels among US adults age 20 years and above was obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES assesses the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. NHANES surveys are conducted using a combination of interviews and physical examinations of a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons. More information on the survey methodology can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/).
