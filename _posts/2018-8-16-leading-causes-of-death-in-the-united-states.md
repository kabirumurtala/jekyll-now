In the United States, average life expectancy is 78.8 years. The 2014 mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that a total of 2,626,418 deaths were reported in the United States, translating to an age-adjusted death rate of 823.7 deaths per 100,000 population. According to the data from the CDC, the leading causes of death in the United States, in rank order are: Heart Disease, Cancer, Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease, Unintentional Injuries, Stroke, Alzheimer's Disease, Diabetes, Influenza and Pneumonia, Kidney Disease, Suicide, Septicemia, Chronic Liver Disease and Cirrhosis, Essential Hypertension and Hypertensive Renal Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Homicide, and Pneumonitis Due to Solids and Liquids.

Heart disease and cancer have topped the list as the leading causes of death in the United States for many years. However, the gap between the number of heart disease and cancer deaths has narrowed because the mortality from heart disease has declined faster than the mortality from cancer.

Between 1999 and 2013, the number of deaths due to nine causes decreased:

-   Stroke by 41.3%
-   Heart Disease by 36.3%
-   Influenza and Pneumonia by 32.4%
-   Cancer by 18.7%
-   Diabetes by 15.3%
-   Homicide by 13.5%
-   Pneumonitis due to Solids and Liquids by 8.3%
-   Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease by 7.2%, and
-   Septicemia by 4.6%

Between the same period, the number of deaths due to seven causes increased:

-   Kidney Disease by 1.2%
-   Chronic Liver Disease and Cirrhosis by 6.2%
-   Unintentional Injuries by 11.6%
-   Suicide by 20.4%
-   Parkinson's Disease by 35.6%
-   Essential Hypertension and Hypertensive Renal Disease by 36.7, and
-   Alzheimer's Disease by 42.8%

As illustrated in the maps below, mortality data from the CDC also shows that age-adjusted death rates for all of the leading causes of death vary across geographic units (such as states) and over time.

Data Source
-----------

Data was obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) mortality data - a web-based data management system that collects and disseminates demographic, geographic, and cause-of-death information in the United States. The data collected are comparable for small geographic areas and are also used to compare mortality trends with other countries. More information on the data collection methods and procedures can be found [here](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm).
