Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, resulting in the death of at least 600,000 people every year. Major cardiovascular disease mortality, commonly reported by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), represents International Classification of Diseases , Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes I00-I78. It includes deaths from heart diseases (ICD-10 codes I00-I09, I11, I13, I20-I51), essential hypertension and hypertensive renal diseases (I10, I12, I15) as well as cerebrovascular diseases (I60-169).

2013 data displayed in the map above shows that Alaska, Colorado, Minnesota, and New Mexico, had the lowest major cardiovascular disease mortality rates with values between 201 - 250 deaths per 100,000 people. Major cardiovascular disease mortality rates were highest in the South with Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Tennessee having values greater than 350 deaths per 100,000 people.

Non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest rate of major cardiovascular disease mortality among adults in the United States, followed by Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, and "Other races/ethnic groups" in decreasing order. Between 2001 and 2013, Non-Hispanic Blacks had the biggest drop in mortality rates among all ethnic groups (35.4%), followed by Hispanics (34.9%), Non-Hispanic Whites (33.5%) and Other races/ethnic groups (29.9%).

We can also see that nationally, the prevalence of major cardiovascular disease mortality was higher in males than in females. Between 2001 and 2013, males had a drop in mortality rates of about 31.8% and females about 37.7%.

Major cardiovascular disease mortality rates was significantly higher for the oldest age group (65+). However, from 2001 to 2013, a downward trend can be observed in mortality among adults 65+ years, with a 34.6% decline.

Data Source
-----------

Data was obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Mortality data - a web-based data management system that collects and disseminates demographic, geographic, and cause-of-death information in the United States. The data collected are comparable for small geographic areas and are also used to compare mortality trends with other countries. More information on the data collection methods and procedures can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm).
