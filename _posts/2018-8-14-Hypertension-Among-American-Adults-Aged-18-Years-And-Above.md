Hypertension, also called high blood pressure is a condition that occurs when the force of blood flowing through the blood vessels is greater than normal. This increases the heart's workload and exerts excessive pressure on the walls of arteries. The abnormally high pressure on the arterial walls may potentially lead to severe damage to the arteries and by extension important organs such as the heart, kidneys and brain. In many cases, hypertension develops insidiously, and it is often referred to as a silent killer because patients may be asymptomatic for many years. Hypertension among US adults is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is therefore not a surprise that the prevention, early detection, and management of hypertension have become one of the major public health challenges.

Normal blood pressure is defined as blood pressure that is less than 120/80 mm Hg (systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg) most of the time. On the other hand, high blood pressure is defined as blood pressure is greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg) most of the time. A systolic blood pressure persistently between 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure persistently between 80 to 89 mm Hg is defined as prehypertension. Individuals with prehypertension have a higher risk of developing heart disease than those with normal blood pressure. Overall, the prevalence of prehypertension among U.S. adults was 23.9% in 2014. Male (29.4%) adults had significantly higher prevalence of prehypertension than female (18.5%) adults.

Causes of hypertension among US adults
--------------------------------------

### Primary hypertension

For most adults with hypertension (about 90%), the cause of their hypertension is unknown. This type of hypertension is called primary or essential hypertension and it develops gradually over many years.

Primary hypertension has many risk factors, including:

-   Age: The risk of hypertension increases with advancing age. In the U.S, the overall prevalence of hypertension among adults was 30.8%% in 2014 and increased with age: 18-24 (2.5%), 25-44 (12.9%), 45-64 (41.2%), and 65+ (69.5%).
-   Race: Non-Hispanic blacks have the highest risk of hypertension. In 2014, the prevalence of hypertension was higher among non-Hispanic black (42.4%) than non-Hispanic white (29.9%), Hispanic (28.1%), or non-Hispanic Asian (27.1%) adults.

-   Gender: The risk between males and females is different when stratified by age. Below the age of 45 years, hypertension is more common in men. After the age of 65 years, women are more likely to develop hypertension than men.

In addition to age, race, and gender, other risk factors for primary hypertension include:

-   Genetics/family history of hypertension.
-   Being overweight or obese.
-   Sedentary lifestyle/physical inactivity.
-   Smoking.
-   Excessive consumption of alcohol.
-   Poor diet which may include too much salt/sodium, too little potassium, too little fruits/vegetables.

Some risk factors such as age, race, genetics, and family history cannot be changed. Other risk factors that can be treated or changed include overweight/obesity, tobacco use, physical inactivity, excessive consumption of of alcohol, and poor diet.

### Secondary hypertension

In about 10% of adults with hypertension, an underlying, potentially correctable cause can be identified. In this case, it is called secondary hypertension. After the underlying cause has been treated, blood pressure usually returns to normal or is significantly reduced. These causes include:

-   Chronic kidney disease.
-   Endocrine disorders arising from excess production of hormones from the adrenal gland, parathyroid glands, and pituitary gland.
-   Coarctation of the aorta.
-   Side effects of medications such as steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and some hormonal contraceptives.
-   Pregnancy induced hypertension.

Awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension
-------------------------------------------------

Patient awareness of hypertension is an important element in effective treatment and ultimately achieving blood pressure control. The goal of treatment is to achieve blood pressure control and lower the risks of complications.

Treatment consists of the following interventions:

-   Lifestyle changes such as weight loss, regular moderate intensity exercise, cessation of smoking, and reduced alcohol consumption.
-   Healthy diet, also referred to as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. This involves eating more fruits, vegetables, whole-grain foods, low-fat dairy, fish, and poultry. Reducing the consumption of red meat, saturated fats, and salt (sodium) in the diet is also highly recommended.
-   Medications, if lifestyle changes, exercise and healthy diet are not enough. The most common classes include diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and renin inhibitors.

Among all U.S. adults with hypertension, 80.6% were aware of their hypertension, 65.5% were taking medication to lower their blood pressure, and only 49.6% achieved blood pressure control.

### Hypertension awareness, treatment, and control rates vary by race and gender:

Overall, the awareness of hypertension was higher among non-Hispanic White (83.6%) than non-Hispanic Asian (68.2%) adults. Non-Hispanic White (69.3%) and non-Hispanic Black (63.6%) adults were more likely to be on medication for hypertension than non-Hispanic Asian (48.2%) adults. Also, non-Hispanic White (55.7%) adults had a higher prevalence of controlled high blood pressure, compared with non-Hispanic Black (39.9%), Hispanic (40.6%), and non-Hispanic Asian (34.5%) adults.

More females (86.8%) than males (76.5%) had higher awareness of hypertension. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the prevalence of hypertension medication between females and males.

Data Source
-----------

Data was obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES assesses the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. NHANES surveys are conducted using a combination of interviews and physical examinations of a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons. More information on the survey methodology can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/).
