Obesity is defined as excessive accumulation of body fat that presents a risk to health. A good indicator of a person's body fat is the body mass index (BMI). BMI is a person's weight in kilograms, divided by the square of his or her height in meters. People with BMI of 30 or more are generally considered obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, mental illness, and cancer. Researchers [estimated](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629611001366) that the annual medical cost of obesity-related illnesses in the US was $190 billion dollars (approximately 21% of the total annual health spending).

Prevalence of obesity (self-reported) among US adults by States
---------------------------------------------------------------

According to data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the prevalence of self-reported obesity among US adults aged 18 years and above was highest in the Southern and Midwestern regions of the country. Southern states like Mississippi, West Virginia, and Arkansas have prevalence rates greater than 35.1%. Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, California, and Vermont had the lowest prevalence rates with values between 20% and 25%. The bad news is that no state had a prevalence rate less than 20%.

Prevalence of obesity among US adults by gender, age group and race/ethnicity
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The prevalence of obesity among US adults aged 20 years and above was 36.5% during 2011-2014. Overall, the prevalence of obesity was higher among women (38.4%) than among men (34.4%).

Men aged 40-59 years (38.3%) had a higher prevalence of obesity than men aged 20-39 years (30.3%). There was no statistical significant difference between the prevalence of obesity among men aged 20-39 years (30.3%) and men aged 60+ years (34.9%). Similarly, women aged 40-59 years (42.0%) had a higher prevalence of obesity than women aged 20-39 years (34.4%). There was no statistical significant difference in the prevalence of obesity among women aged 20-39 years (34.4%) and women aged 60+ years (38.8%).

Overall, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was highest among non-Hispanic black (47.8%) adults. This was followed by Hispanic (42.6%), and non-Hispanic white (34.6%) adults.

There was no statistically significant difference in the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity between non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white men. Also, there was no statistically significant difference in the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity between non-Hispanic black and Hispanic men.

Among women, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was highest among non-Hispanic black (56.0%) adults. This was followed by Hispanic (45.9%), and non-Hispanic white (35.5%) adults.

Data Source
-----------

State level data on the prevalence of self-reported obesity among US adults aged 18 years and above was obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2014. BRFSS is a state-based surveillance system that collects information of the non-institutionalized civilian population in the U.S. using random-digit-dialed landline and cellular phones. More information on the sampling methodology can be found [here](http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/).

Data on the prevalence of obesity among US adults age 20 years and above (by gender, age group and race/ethnicity) was obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The NHANES surveys routinely assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. Surveys to estimate Body Mass Index in the US population are conducted using physical examinations (weight, and standing height) of a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons. More information on the survey methodology can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/).
