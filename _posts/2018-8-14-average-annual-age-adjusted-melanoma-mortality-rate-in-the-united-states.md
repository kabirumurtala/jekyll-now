Melanoma is caused by damage to the skin from exposure to ultraviolet rays. The ultraviolet rays may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as indoor tanning devices. Melanoma is the least common but the most deadly form of skin cancer in the United States. Though melanoma accounts for approximately 1% of all cases of skin cancers diagnosed in the United States, it causes majority of skin cancer deaths. In the past couple of decades, there has been an upward trend in the number of melanoma cases diagnosed. The good news is that due to factors such as increased screening, early diagnosis, and better treatment techniques, there has been an increase in the overall 5-year survival rate of malignant melanoma. Also the overall melanoma mortality rate in the United States has increased at a slower rate over the past decade.

According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 9,000 people in the United States die from melanoma each year. The average annual age-adjusted melanoma mortality rate in the United States was 2.7 deaths per 100,000 people. There were significant variation in mortality rates among states. As shown in the map below, the states with the lowest average annual age-adjusted melanoma mortality rate in the United States include Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, New York, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Rhode Island, Texas, Connecticut, Minnesota, and New Jersey. At the opposite end of the spectrum, states with the highest average annual age-adjusted melanoma mortality rate include Indiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Tennessee, Wyoming, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Colorado, Oregon, West Virginia, Idaho, and Utah.

Data Source
-----------

Data was obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) mortality data - a web-based data management system that collects and disseminates demographic, geographic, and cause-of-death information in the United States. The data collected are comparable for small geographic areas and are also used to compare mortality trends with other countries. More information on the data collection methods and procedures can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm).
