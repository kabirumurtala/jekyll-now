Water fluoridation is the practice of adding fluoride to public water supplies in order to prevent or reduce tooth decay in the population. In the United States, water fluoridation as a public health intervention started in 1945. Since then, the water fluoridation rates in the United States has increased steadily. By 2014, 67.2% of the total U.S. population had access to fluoridated water, and 74.7% of the U.S. population on Community Water System (CWS) had access to fluoridated water. Fluoridation of public water supplies is a major factor responsible for the drastic reduction in tooth decay in the U.S. and it was named one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.

The water fluoridation rates in the United States vary from state to state. Hawaii and New Jersey have the lowest percentage of residents supplied with fluoridated water, with less than 20 percent of their residents served by community water system with fluoridated water. On other hand, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and District of Columbia all have more than 80 percent of their residents served by community water system with fluoridated water.
